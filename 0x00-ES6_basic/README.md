ES6, or ECMAScript 6, is the sixth edition of the ECMAScript language specification, standardized by ECMA International. It introduced significant improvements and new features to JavaScript, making it more powerful and easier to work with. Some key features of ES6 include:

1- Arrow Functions: A shorter syntax for writing functions.
const add = (a, b) => a + b;

2- Classes: A new syntax for defining classes and inheritance.
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

3- Template Literals: Enhanced string capabilities with embedded expressions.
const name = 'Chaimae';
console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);

4- Destructuring: A way to unpack values from arrays or properties from objects.
const [a, b] = [1, 2];
const {name, age} = {name: 'Chaimae', age: 27};

5- Modules: Support for importing and exporting functions, objects, or primitives.
// In file.js
export const hello = () => console.log('Hello!');

// In another file
import { hello } from './file.js';
hello();

6- Promises: A new way to handle asynchronous operations.
const fetchData = () => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Asynchronous operation
  });
};


These features, among others, have greatly enhanced the functionality and readability of JavaScript.
